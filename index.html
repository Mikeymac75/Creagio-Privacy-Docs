    <h1>Privacy Policy for Cresagio Garden</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 16, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Cresagio Garden ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> With your explicit permission, we collect your device's precise location (latitude and longitude). This is used to determine your gardening hardiness zone, provide local weather forecasts, and calculate frost dates. You can disable location services at any time in your device settings.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Garden Data:</strong> We store the information you create within the app. This includes your list of plants, their nicknames, planting dates ("My Garden"), your selected plants in the "Seed Bank," any "Custom Plants" you create, and journal entries, which may include text and photos you upload from your device.</li>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> We store your preferences, such as your preferred temperature unit and any custom watering schedules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of the data listed above is <strong>stored locally and securely on your device</strong>. We do not upload or store this personal information on our servers.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide Core App Functionality:</strong> Your location is used to calculate your hardiness zone and fetch relevant weather data. Your garden data is used to generate custom tasks, alerts, and calendar events.</li>
        <li><strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong> We use your preferences to display information in your preferred format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal information with any third parties, with one exception:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weather Service:</strong> To provide weather forecasts, we send your device's latitude and longitude to the Norwegian Meteorological Institute API. No other personal information is sent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since all your garden data, journal entries, and photos are stored only on your device, we do not have access to it and cannot share it with anyone.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard secure storage mechanisms provided by the mobile operating system to protect the information stored on your device.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>All user-generated data, including your garden list, custom plants, journal entries, and photos, is stored exclusively on your local device. We do not collect or store this information on our servers.</p>
    <p>To delete all of your application data, please uninstall the Cresagio Garden application from your device. This is the standard procedure for removing locally stored data and will permanently erase all information associated with the app from your phone.</p>
